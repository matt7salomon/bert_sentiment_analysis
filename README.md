# bert_sentiment_analysis

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful language model developed by Google, primarily designed for understanding the context of words in a sentence through bidirectional training. When applied to sentiment analysis, BERT leverages its deep understanding of context to classify the sentiment of a given text. Here’s how BERT performs sentiment analysis:

1. Preprocessing the Input Text

	•	Tokenization: The input text is tokenized using BERT’s tokenizer, which converts words into tokens, including handling subwords and unknown words. BERT adds special tokens [CLS] at the beginning and [SEP] at the end of the sequence.
	•	Padding and Truncation: The sequence is either padded or truncated to a fixed length, suitable for batching.

2. Embedding the Input

	•	Input Embeddings: Each token is converted into a vector embedding, which is a combination of three embeddings: token embedding (from BERT’s vocabulary), position embedding (indicating the position of the token in the sequence), and segment embedding (indicating which sentence a token belongs to in tasks with multiple sentences).

3. Passing through BERT Model

	•	Encoder Layers: The token embeddings pass through multiple transformer layers in BERT. These layers apply self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks to capture the relationships between all tokens in the input sequence, both forward and backward. This bidirectional context is crucial for understanding nuances in sentiment.

4. Extracting the [CLS] Token Representation

	•	[CLS] Token: The representation of the [CLS] token at the output layer of BERT is used for classification tasks. This token is designed to capture the aggregated information of the entire sequence, making it suitable for tasks like sentiment analysis.

5. Adding a Classification Layer

	•	Dense Layer: A dense (fully connected) layer is typically added on top of the BERT model to perform the classification. The output from the [CLS] token is passed through this layer to predict sentiment.
	•	Activation Function: For binary sentiment analysis (e.g., positive vs. negative), a sigmoid activation function may be used, while for multi-class sentiment analysis (e.g., positive, negative, neutral), a softmax activation is applied.

6. Training the Model

	•	Fine-Tuning: The model is fine-tuned on a labeled sentiment analysis dataset, adjusting the weights of BERT along with the classification layer. Fine-tuning helps the model learn specific nuances related to sentiment in the dataset.

7. Inference

	•	Prediction: During inference, a new text input is processed through the tokenization and BERT model pipeline, and the classification layer provides the sentiment prediction, typically as probabilities for each sentiment class.

Summary

BERT performs sentiment analysis by leveraging its deep contextual understanding of text, using the [CLS] token representation to classify the sentiment. By fine-tuning on specific sentiment analysis datasets, BERT can adapt to the task and provide accurate predictions based on the context within the input text.
